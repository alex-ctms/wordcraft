# Read Aloud

> **Last updated:** 2026-10-20 · **Change:** minor (neural voice on this computer, voice lists; previously minor: voice roles; previously minor: text rules; previously minor: first version: how much Read Aloud reads at one time)

Read Aloud reads the document to you. It highlights the sentence that it reads, and the caret
follows that sentence.
This page tells you how to choose the voice and how much text Read Aloud reads at one time.
It also tells you what Read Aloud skips.
It also tells you how to give parts of the text to different voices.

All the settings are in **File › Options › Accessibility › Read Aloud**. The Read Aloud player
also has a link to them. Agents, the CLI and MCP use the `readAloud.settings` command. WordCraft
keeps the settings in `ui.json`.

## Voice engines

Read Aloud has two voice engines. Select one engine.

| Engine | Setting | Where the speech is made | What you must install |
|---|---|---|---|
| System voice | `"engine": "system"` | On this computer | Nothing on macOS and Windows. On Linux and BSD, install `espeak-ng`. |
| Neural voice (Piper) | `"engine": "local"` | On this computer | Piper and one Piper voice model (`.onnx`). |

The system voice is the default. The neural voice sounds more natural.

### Set up the neural voice (Piper)

1. Install Piper. Make sure that the `piper` program is on your `PATH`.
2. Download a Piper voice model. A model is an `.onnx` file and a `.onnx.json` file.
3. Open **File › Options › Accessibility**.
4. Select **Neural voice on this computer (Piper)**.
5. In **Voice model**, select the model from the list. If the model is not in the list, select
   **Browse…** in the list, or type the full path of the `.onnx` file.

The list shows the `.onnx` files in the folders of the models that you use, and in the usual
download folders (for example `~/.local/share/piper-voices`). Piper 1.8 installs with
`uv tool install piper-tts`. Its `python -m piper.download_voices` command downloads models.

Read Aloud gives the sentence to the program on stdin. The program writes a WAV file. The
default arguments are:

```
--model {voice} --output_file {output} --length_scale {lengthScale}
```

You can use a different program, for example a script that starts a different neural voice.
Change **Program** and **Arguments** in File › Options. Read Aloud fills in these fields for
each sentence:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `{voice}` | The voice of the role, or else the default voice model |
| `{output}` | The WAV file that the program must write |
| `{rate}` | The speed, for example `1.25` |
| `{lengthScale}` | The length of the speech, `1 / speed` (Piper uses this) |

### When a voice fails

If the neural voice cannot make a sentence, the system voice reads that sentence. The player
shows the reason, for example a missing program or a missing voice model. Read Aloud stops only
if the system voice also fails.

## How much Read Aloud reads at one time

Set **Read at a time** (`"chunk"`):

- **One paragraph** (`paragraph`, the default). Read Aloud prepares one paragraph, reads it, and
  then goes to the next paragraph.
- **One page** (`page`). Read Aloud prepares the paragraphs that start on one page.
- **The whole document** (`document`). Read Aloud prepares all the sentences at the start.

The neural voice renders all the sentences of the paragraph or page before the player gets to
them. With the whole document, it renders three sentences ahead.
The player shows the paragraph or page that it reads, for example "Paragraph 3 / 40".

**Next sentence** and **Previous sentence** go across paragraphs and pages.

## Text rules

The text rules change only the spoken text. The text on the page does not change, and the
highlight stays on the words as written. Read Aloud always removes invisible characters (zero-width
spaces, direction marks, soft hyphens).

| Setting (`text.…`) | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Web addresses (`urls`) | `domain` | `read` reads all of the address. `domain` reads only the site name (`https://www.example.com/a` becomes `example.com`). `skip` removes it. |
| Skip emoji (`skipEmoji`) | off | Removes emoji, skin tones and flags. |
| Skip symbols (`skipSymbols`) | on | Removes arrows, box and shape characters, bullets and icon-font characters. |
| Skip markup characters (`skipMarkup`) | off | Removes `*`, `#`, `_`, `~`, `\|`, `^`, `` ` ``, `<`, `>`, `=` and `\`. |
| Skip text in [square brackets] (`skipBrackets`) | off | Removes the brackets and the text in them. |
| Skip text in (parentheses) (`skipParentheses`) | off | Removes the parentheses and the text in them. |
| Skip repeated punctuation (`collapseRepeats`) | on | Removes four or more of the same mark in a row, for example `*****` or `-----`. |
| Characters to skip (`skipChars`) | empty | Removes each character in the list. |
| Say instead (`replacements`) | empty | Replaces text before the voice reads it. Write one per line: `& = and`. |
| Skip text that matches (`skipPatterns`) | empty | Removes text that matches a regular expression. Write one per line. |

Read Aloud applies the rules in this order: replacements, patterns, web addresses, brackets and
parentheses, emoji, symbols, markup, characters to skip, repeated punctuation.

Example: `{"text": {"replacements": [{"from": "Dr.", "to": "Doctor"}], "skipPatterns": ["\\[\\d+\\]"]}}`
reads "Dr. Lee [12]" as "Doctor Lee".

## Voice roles

Use voice roles to give parts of the text to different voices. The Narrator reads all text that
has no marker. The default roles are Voice A, Voice B and Voice C.

To change the voice, type the marker character and a role label before the text. The default
marker is `§`.

```
The door opened. §A Who is there? §B: Only me. §N The wind blew.
```

- The Narrator reads "The door opened."
- Voice A reads "Who is there?"
- Voice B reads "Only me."
- The Narrator reads "The wind blew."

Rules for markers:

- The label can have a colon after it (`§B:`). Read Aloud does not read the marker, the label, the
  colon or the spaces after them.
- `§N` and `§Narrator` go back to the Narrator.
- Labels are not case-sensitive (`§a` is the same as `§A`).
- If the label is not a role, Read Aloud reads the text as written. Thus `§5` in a legal text is
  read as written.
- **A marker changes the voice** (`voices.scope`): `paragraph` (the default) goes back to the
  Narrator at the end of the paragraph. `untilNext` keeps the voice until the next marker, also
  in the paragraphs that follow.

To set the roles, use the table in **File › Options › Accessibility › Read Aloud: voices**:

- **Label**: the text after the marker. Use letters, digits and `_`, 24 characters maximum.
- **System voice**, **Neural voice**: the voice for each engine. Select a voice from the list
  next to the field, or type a voice name or a path in the field.
  - The system list shows the voices of the speech program (`say -v '?'` on macOS,
    `espeak-ng --voices` on Linux and BSD, the installed voices on Windows).
  - The neural list shows the Piper models that WordCraft finds. Select **Browse…** to select a
    model file in a different folder.
  - **Default voice** clears the field. An empty field uses the default voice of the engine.
- Select **Find voices again** after you install a voice.
- **Speed**: the speed of the role, relative to the reading speed (0.5× to 2×).

Use **Add a voice** to add a role. You can have 26 roles and the Narrator. To use a different
marker, type one character in **Marker character**. The marker cannot be a letter, a digit, a
space, `_` or `:`.

## Command reference

`readAloud.settings` with no parameters returns all the settings. With parameters, it changes the
settings that you name. If one value is not correct, the command changes nothing and returns an
error. If Read Aloud is reading, it continues from the same sentence with the new settings.

```
wordcraft-cli run --template sample \
  --cmd 'readAloud.settings={"chunk":"page","voices":{"marker":"^"}}' \
  --cmd review.readAloud
```

For safety, `readAloud.settings` cannot change `local.program` or `local.args`. These settings
choose the program that WordCraft runs. Change them in **File › Options › Accessibility**. The
command accepts the same values that it returned, so an agent can send the settings back.

`readAloud.voices` returns the voices in the lists: `system` and `local`, each a list of
`{"id", "label"}`. With `{"refresh": true}`, it asks the speech program again.

`readAloud.status` also returns `engine`, `chunk`, `chunkIndex`, `chunkCount` and `voice` (the role
label of the sentence that Read Aloud reads).

## Future work

These items are not in WordCraft yet:

- **Voices from quotation marks.** Read text in quotation marks with a dialogue voice, and read the
  text outside them with the Narrator. This needs rules for nested quotes and for the quote
  characters of each language.
- **Voices from the speaker.** Find the speaker of a quote from words near it ("said Anna", "Anna
  asked") and give the quote to the role for Anna.
- **Voices from pronouns.** Use pronouns near a quote ("she said", "they asked") and the last
  speaker that was named, to keep the same voice for the same character.
- **A character list.** Let the user map character names to roles, and keep the list with the
  document.
- **Word highlight.** Highlight each word as the voice reads it. This needs word timings from the
  voice engine.
- **Translations.** The new Options text has translations in Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech,
  Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Swedish, Turkish and Vietnamese. The other languages show
  it in English. The command labels have translations in all languages.
